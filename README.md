# UI overview
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It serves as the frontend for the hotbutterfly project to rank the beauty of butterflies in pairwise contests. Using Next.js's server, we proxy the requests to our [actual backend server](https://github.com/jzengg/hotbutterfly). This web app primarily serves user's coming from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) marketplace. To that end, the first step before ranking butterflies is a form where users must supply their MTurk information and upon completion of the survey, the app presents a completion code that can be submitted to Amazon which lets us filter out fraudulent users. 

Admin functionality exists to view match records, download CSVs of data, and view rankings.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
